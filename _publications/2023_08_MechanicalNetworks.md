excerpt: 'In this paper, mechanical networks or closed-loop mechanisms are explored. First, the way kinematic joints are constructed, exploring the freedoms of kinematic joints in terms of screws and then further the way that a rigid body can be constrained to generate freedom for a joint. This sets the base theory for how mechanical networks are constructed. The paper delves into how the kinematic joints and the bodies in a mechanism can be described using directed graphs and the matrices of connectivity and loops that can be generated from it. This is called a mechanical network. Using these mechanical networked joints, a matrix of simple joint freedoms or constraints can be constructed. These matrices can be manipulated using the connectivity, loop, and node descriptions to describe a mechanism's geometric mobility and preloadability. Mobility here describes how many displacements are required to describe all the possible kinematic displacements of the mechanism. Alternatively, this can be stated as the number of actuators required to move the mechanism through a motion while maintaining kinematic equilibrium. Preloadability describes the number of joint preloads required to be defined to maintain the static equilibrium of the mechanism. Both these notions are significant, they effectively allow a design engineer, or even a controls engineer to understand the constraints that they are faced with when deciding on mechanisms to be used for a particular task. To enhance this
information, two case studies are explored, one of a lift mechanism, and another of a 3-RRR Spherical Parallel Platform, or Spherical Wrist. The lift mechanism is designed to ideally have one actuation, and lift an object at its end effector while maintaining orientation. This mechanism has mobility of 1. This investigation describes and confirms it as a single point of actuation and uses miter gears, which are 4 degrees of freedom joints to show how they maintain the rotational speed through the mechanism. The spherical wrist was studied by Max Stein, looking at the forward and inverse kinematics and statics of the mechanism. Of note, the mechanism is statically indeterminate. Here this investigation describes and evaluates what joint preloads to define to avoid this indeterminacy.'
