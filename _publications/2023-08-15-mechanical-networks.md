permalink: /publication/2023-08-15-mechanical-networks
excerpt: 'This paper delves into how the kinematic joints and the bodies in a mechanism can be described using directed graphs and the matrices of connectivity and loops that can be generated from it. This is called a mechanical network. Using these mechanical networked joints, a matrix of simple joint freedoms or constraints can be constructed. These matrices can be manipulated using the connectivity, loop, and node descriptions to describe a mechanism&apos;s geometric mobility and preloadability. To enhance this information, two case studies are explored, one of a lift mechanism, and another of a 3-RRR Spherical Parallel Platform, or Spherical Wrist. '
